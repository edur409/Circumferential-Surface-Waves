The curvature can cause apparent phase velocities not related to the true speed of a material.  Even changes in the phase of the waveforms have been reported in the literature (See Clorennec and Royer (2003) and Brune et al.

In other words, if the dimensionless frequency $k_p$ is mistaken for the spherical harmonic order (co-latitudinal order) $l$ and given only integer values, then **Jeans' rule** or **Jeans' equation** ($k_p = l + 1/2$ or $2 \\pi R/ \\lambda = l + 1/2$) is not satisfied.
