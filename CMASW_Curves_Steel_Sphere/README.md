The image above illustrates the difference between: 1) assuming that an integer number of wavelengths fit around the circumference (Clorennec & Royer 2004), and 2) assuming the number of wavelengths around the circumference is an integer and a half (Gallezot et al. (2020)), as per seismological observations.

The dispersion curve as a function of frequency is shown below.
