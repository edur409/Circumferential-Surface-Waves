The image above illustrates the difference between: 1) assuming that an integer number of wavelengths fit around the circumference (Clorennec & Royer 2004), and 2) assuming the number of wavelengths around the circumference is an integer and a half (Gallezot et al. (2020)), as per seismological observations.  In seismology, the fact that the number of wavelengths around the circumference is an integer and a half is known as *Jeans` rule* or *Jeans` equation*.  

## Jeans's formula

The standing waves formed by the interference of seismic surface waves travelling several times around the circumference of the Earth should satisfy:

$$ka = l + \frac{1}{2}$$ 

where $l$ is the mode number, $k = w/c$ , $w = 2 \pi/ T$ , $T$ is the period of free oscillations, $a$ is the radius of the Earth, and $c$ is the phase velocity of the corresponding traveling waves.

From Brune (1964) we know that every polar passage of a surface wave around the earth produces a phase shift of $\pi/2$ ($\lambda/4$).  He demonstrated this also over the surface of a sphere of steel.

The dispersion curve as a function of frequency is shown below.
