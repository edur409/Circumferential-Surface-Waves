# Dispersion Curves for Circumferential Surface Waves

The way in which a surface wave propagates (i.e. Rayleigh wave) on the surface of a cylinder differs from that of 
an infinite flat half space when the wavelengths are comparable to the circumference ($2 \pi radius/wavelength$ < 200).  
The curvature can cause apparent velocities not related to the true speed of a
material.  Even changes in the phase of the waveforms have been reported in the literature (See Clorennec and Royer (2003)
for instance).

The equations presented in Cerv's paper and those in Viktorov's book produce exactly the same dispersion curve results.  The circumferential
surface wave around the outline of a thin disk is equivalent to that of a cylinder.

Liu et. al, (1998) is a good reference to the problem of surface waves in thin pipes.
